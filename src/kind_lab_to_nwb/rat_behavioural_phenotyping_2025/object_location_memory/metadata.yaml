  experiment_description: |
    This experiment is part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/.
    As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB. 
    Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
    Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.
    This experiment investigated object location memory in different rat models 
    (Arid1b: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=14394518, 
    Grin2b: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=14394515, 
    Scn2a: https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/strain/main.html?id=25394530).
    The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
    The task utilized two custom-built arenas (60x60 cm) with different wall colors and bedding.
    Rats underwent habituation followed by sample and test trials to assess their ability to detect object location changes.
    The protocol included group habituation (10 min), individual habituation (2 days, 10 min each),
    sample trials (15 min with two identical objects), and test trials (3 min) with one object moved to a new location.
    Both short-term (5 min delay) and long-term (1 hr delay) memory were assessed.
    Object exploration was recorded via CCTV camera and manually scored using BORIS software.

      Experimental Day 5. Short-term memory test. 
      Two identical objects (e.g. ceramic tea lights, glass ornaments, never face or animal related) 
      were fixed in diagonally opposing corners of the arena (10 cm from the sides of the arena). 
      A rat was placed individually in the arena with the objects for a 15 min sample trial. 
      The rat was then removed and placed in the holding bucket for 5 min. 
      The objects were removed from the arena and wiped with 70% ethanol, the arena floor covering was cleared of debris,
      mixed and flattened. The objects were returned to arena with one in the same location and one moved 
      from the corner to the middle of the wall (the object that moved was counterbalanced across genotype). 
      The rat was returned to the arena for a 3 min test trial, 5 min after the sample trial.
