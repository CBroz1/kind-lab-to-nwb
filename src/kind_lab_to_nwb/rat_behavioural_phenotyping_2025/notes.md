# Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline:
All experiments are part of the Rat Behavioural Phenotyping Pipeline Methodologies 
https://sidb.org.uk/facilities/rat-behavioural-phenotyping-pipeline/
As an initial effort to characterize the rat lines, these models are being behaviorally phenotyped at SIDB.

Rat models are phenotyped according to a rigorous pipeline that assesses behaviours relevant to autism with intellectual disability, such as social and motor skills, and learning and sensory processing. 
Different cohorts of rats are run through different subsets of tasks to overcome potential order effects on behaviours and to limit the number of tasks each animal is put through.

## 1. OBJECT LOCATION MEMORY (OLM)
### Apparatus: 
for this task two custom built arenas (60x60 cm, Kanya UK), located in different rooms were used. One arena had black laminated wood walls and fresh woodchip bedding on the floor, and one had white laminated wood walls and white nesting bedding on the floor. Different spatial cues were used in each arena (e.g. A4 black and white striped sheet attached to one wall, or a large egg box fixed in top corner). Rats were randomly assigned to be tested for long term memory in one arena and short-term memory in the other arena, counterbalancing across genotype. The light intensity in the arenas was uniformly maintained at ~20 lx. Objects were secured in fixed locations within the arena using 3m Dualock tape approximately 10cm from the sides of the arena. A CCTV camera fixed above the arenas recorded all trials. An opaque black bucket (approx. 32 x 23 x 36 cm, with lid) with bedding from all home cages of test rats was used to hold rats between trials. 
### Procedure:  
habituation stage included group and individual habituation. On day 1 rats were placed in the arena (that they were assigned) with their cagemates for 10 min. For the next two days, rats were placed in the arena individually for 10 min. 
On day 5, two identical objects (e.g. ceramic tea lights, glass ornaments, never face or animal related) were fixed in diagonally opposing corners of the arena (10 cm from the sides of the arena). A rat was placed individually in the arena with the objects for a 15 min sample trial. The rat was then removed and placed in the holding bucket for 5 min. The objects were removed from the arena and wiped with 70% ethanol, the arena floor covering was cleared of debris, mixed and flattened. The objects were returned to arena with one in the same location and one moved from the corner to the middle of the wall (see Fig 4.1; the object that moved was counterbalanced across genotype).  The rat was returned to the arena for a 3 min test trial. To test long term memory, rats were returned to the arena 1 hr after the sample trial; to test short term memory, rats were returned to the arena 5 min following the sample trial. 
The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
### Analysis: 
videos of sample and test trials were scored manually using BORIS software (Friard, University of Torino) to quantify object exploration (defined as a rat directing its nose to an object within whisking distance, licking objects, placing head inside objects, climbing on with nose directed at object, but not climbing on with nose directed away from objects). A discrimination index (DI) for the exploration of the novel vs familiar location of the objects was calculated using the following formula:  DI = timenovel – timefamiliar / timenovel + familiar  ,where time is the amount of exploration in seconds associated with the ‘novel’, newly located object, and ‘familiar’, the amount of time the rat explored the object that  that remained in the same place.
Parameters that were analysed in sample trials included total object exploration time in accumulating 1 min time bins (which could be partitioned into time exploring the object in each corner or object identity to look for object bias). In the test trials, total object exploration time and time exploring the novel/familiar object in 10 s accumulating time bins was plotted. Discrimination index was also plotted for 10 s accumulating time bins, and after 10, 15, 20 25 s of accumulated object exploration. Z-Chop software (Oliver Hardt, McGill University) was used to sort data into time bins.

## 2. OBJECT RECOGNITION MEMORY (OR)
### Apparatus: 
for this task a custom-built arena (60x60 cm, Kanya UK) with black laminated wood walls (60 cm) and a grey lino floor was used. The light intensity was uniformly maintained at ~20 lx. Objects were secured in fixed locations within the arena using 3m Dualock tape. A CCTV camera fixed above the arena recorded all trials. An opaque black bucket (approx. 32 x 23 x 36 cm, with lid) with bedding from all home cages of test rats was used to hold rats between trials.  
### Procedure: 
This task comprised of four stages: habituation, sampling, retention and probe (Fig 5.1). On the first day of habituation, rats were individually placed in the empty arena for 10 min before being returned to their home cages. This was repeated for four days. The arena was cleared of debris and wiped with 70% ethanol between rats. On the testing day (day 5), two identical objects (e.g. ceramic tea lights, glass ornaments, never face or animal related) were fixed in position (approximately 15 cm from the side and top edge of the arena). A rat was placed individually in the arena with the objects for a 15 min sample trial. The rat was then removed and placed in the holding bucket for 5 min. The objects were removed from the arena, the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and the objects replaced with a replica object and one novel object (counterbalanced for location and object between rats). The rat was returned to the arena for a 3 min test trial. To test long term memory, rats were returned to the arena 24 hr after the sample trial. To test short term memory, rats were returned to the arena 5 min after the sample trial.
The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
### Analysis:
videos were scored manually using BORIS software (Friard, University of Torino) to quantify object exploration (defined as a rat directing its nose to an object within whisking distance, licking objects, placing head inside objects, climbing on with nose directed at object, but not climbing on and looking away from objects). A discrimination index (DI) for the exploration of the novel vs familiar object was calculated using the following formula:  DI = timenovel – timefamiliar / timenovel + familiar  (where time is the amount of exploration in seconds and novel is the new object and familiar is the object that was seen in the sample trial). 
Parameters that were analysed in sample trials included total object exploration time in accumulating 1 min time bins (which could be partitioned into time exploring the object on left/right or object identity to look for for object/side bias). In the test trials we analysed total object exploration time and time exploring the novel/familiar object in 10 s accumulating time bins. Discrimination index was also plotted for 10 s accumulating time bins, and after 10, 15, 20 25 s of accumulated object exploration.

## 3. WATER MAZE (WM)
### Apparatus: 
The water maze consisted of a circular pool (2 m diameter) with spatial extra-maze parallax cues provided by large objects hanging from the ceiling and walls (Fig. 7.1). A white curtain could be pulled entirely around the pool to hide the extra maze cues. The pool water was made cloudy using approximately 200 ml of liquid latex and maintained at 28-29°C. An Atlantis platform (10 cm in diameter; Spooner et al., 1994) which could be programmed to rise from the bottom of the pool to become available to the swimming rat was used in daily probe trial as the first swim of each day to test long term memory for the platform’s location. The platform would be completely unavailable for 60 s, then rise to 1-2 cm below the surface of the water so that rats could climb on it (thus avoiding extinction of the platform’s location; Spooner et al., 1994). The platform remained present for all other trials. 
A camera recorded all trials from above. Video tracking software (WaterMaze, formerly ActiMetrix, now a subsidiary of Lafayette Instrument Company, USA) was used to run and analyse the trials. Home cages were placed on heat pads throughout the experiment and rats were towel dried immediately after each swim. The experimenter was blind to genotype and observed the swim trials from behind a partitioning wall.
### Procedure:
‘Visible platform trials’ were conducted first to assess vision, swimming ability and demonstrate to the rats that the platform is the only means of escape (Fig. 7.2A). The platform was raised 1-2 cm above water level and had an object positioned on top to make it clear to the swimming rat. A curtain was drawn around the pool to remove all extra maze cues. The rats were given 4 swims per day with a maximum duration of 2 min, with approximately 15 min between swims. For each swim, the platform moved location (either NE, NW, SE, SW quadrant, approximately 70 cm from the edge) and the swim started from a different release point (N, E, S, W). After the rat found the platform, it was left for 20 s before being carefully lifted, towel dried and returned to its home cage. Rats that did not find the platform were guided to it and left on it for 20 s. 
Next, long term spatial memory was assessed by keeping the platform in the same location (either NE or SW quadrant, 70 cm from the edge) over days approximately 1-2 cm below water level with extra maze cues available to the rats (Fig. 7.2B). This protocol was conducted for 4 days with 4 swims each day. Each swim was 2 min max in duration. Each of the 4 daily swims started from a different location (N, E, S, W). After the rat found the platform, it was left for 20 s before being carefully lifted, towel dried and returned to its home cage. Inter-swim time was approximately 15 min. However, the first swim of each day was different. The platform was not present for the first 60 s of the trial, during which dwell time in the target area could be quantified to assess long term memory for the platform location. The platform was raised automatically after 60 s and the rat had a further 60 s to locate and climb onto it (thus preventing extinction of the platform location). 
Finally, to assess reversal learning of the spatial location of the platform, rats were tested in trials in which the platform was located in the opposite quadrant to the previous days (e.g., if in NE, it is now in SW; Fig. 7.2C). The same protocol as for long term memory testing was used over 4 days of testing. During the first swim of each day, in which the platform was not present for the first 60 s, the dwell time in the new and old target area was quantified over days to assess extinction of the old and learning of the new location. 
### Analysis: 
Parameters that were analysed included path length, trial duration, swim speed, dwell time in quadrants, % thigmotaxis (time in outer 12 cm perimeter), all automatically generated by the Actimetrix tracking software.
Morris Water Maze Schematics. A) in visible platform trials the platform was 1-2 cm above the water surface, moved between trials, and spatial cues were not available; B) in long term spatial memory testing the platform remained in the same location over days and was 1-2 cm below water level. Spatial cues were available. In the first swim of each day the platform only became available after 1 min. C) in reversal learning trials the location of platform was moved to the opposite quadrant compared to prior trials. In the first swim of each day the platform only became available after 1 min.

## 4. AUDITORY FEAR CONDITIONING (AFD)
### Apparatus: 
Two different Coulbourn Fear conditioning chambers (Coulbourn, Harvard ### Apparatus, USA) were used to provide two distinct contexts (A and B, Fig. 9), and were placed within sound-attenuating chambers (Coulbourn, USA) so that two animals could be tested at the same time. Context A had a smooth plastic flooring, a curved black and white striped plastic mat across two walls and one wall had black and white tiles. Mint toothpaste (Colgate stripe) was placed in a dish outside the box within the sound attenuating chamber to provide an odour cue. Context B had a grid shock delivery floor, all 3 walls had shiny steel tiles, and no mint odour was present. FreezeFrame 5 software (Actimetrics, Lafayette USA) was used to administer the shock/cues, record trials, and analyse freezing levels (defined as cessation of all behaviour except that associated with breathing).
### Procedure: 
on Day 1 and 2 rats were habituated to context A by being placed in context A for 20 min. Context A was cleaned with 70% ethanol between rats. On Day 3 rats underwent fear conditioning in which tone and foot shock were paired. Rats were placed in context B, and after 2 min received 3 tones (30 s duration, inter tone duration 1 min, tone parameters: 5khz, 75-80dB) which co-terminated with scrambled foot shock of 0.7 mA for a duration of 1 s. Following the last tone presentation, the rats remained in the box for a further 2 min before being removed and placed in a holding cage until all cage mates were tested and then returned to the home cage. Context B was cleaned with SaniWipes between rats. On Day 4 and 5 rats were tested for recall of the conditioned response. Rats were placed in context A and after 2 min received 13 presentations of the tone (30 s duration, inter tone duration 30 s, tone parameters: 5khz, 75-80dB), no foot shocks were presented during recall. Following the 13th tone presentation, rats remained for a further 2 min before being removed and placed in a holding cage until all cage mates were tested and then returned to home cage. Context A was cleaned with 70% ethanol between rats. 
### Analysis: 
All trials were recorded. FreezeFrame 5 software was used to perform analysis and SMP was used to score freezing behaviour (cessation of all movement apart from that associated with breathing). Scorers manually set thresholds for freezing detection for each experiment. The threshold was set to 0 for all habituation trials. For conditioning and recall trials, a variable threshold was determined for each individual rat based on their activity / movement.  The software was used to extract % time freezing in time bins for baseline, tone presentation, and the period between tone presentations (ITI, inter-tone-interval). 
Auditory Fear Conditioning Schematics A) Day 1-2 habituation: animals placed in context A, received no tone or foot shock; B) Day 3 Conditioning: in context B, animals received 3 tones with co-terminating foot shock of 0.7mA for 1 s C) Day 4-5 Fear Recall and Extinction: animals received only tone but no foot shock in context A.

## 5. PREY CAPTURE
### Apparatus: 
The testing apparatus consisted of a plastic square arena (100 x 100 cm) with 50 cm high white walls and a wood-lined floor painted white with lighting maintained at approx. 75 lux, with an ultrasonic vocalisation (USV) recording microphone (M500 USB Pettersson; Wildlife Services UK) hanging approx. 1m above the arena. A CCTV camera was positioned directly overhead to record all trials. Rats were held in an opaque starting cylinder (diameter approx. 20 cm, height 25 cm) with moveable lid before trials and held between trials in a black opaque holding bucket (approx. 32 x 23 x 36 cm) with a lid and bedding from each of the rats’ home cage added to the bottom.
Silent brown crickets (25-30 mm; bought fresh for each experiment from LiveFoodsDirect UK) were maintained in large plastic boxes with access to hydration gel (ProRep bug gel, LiveFoods Direct, UK) and fresh food (e.g. carrot, potatoes, bran flakes, cat biscuits) and only healthy crickets (no signs of disease, all appendages present) were used in the experiments. Crickets were placed in a smaller container and placed on a heat mat for at least 10 min prior to use, to encourage fleeing. Ins t holding tongs (Bug tongs, Forest School Shop UK) were used to manipulate crickets.
### Procedure: 
Rats were habituated over five consecutive days to the testing arena and Procedures associated with testing. On Day 1, cage mates were placed in the arena together for 30 min. On Days 2-5, rats were placed individually for 10 min. On Day 3, rats were placed individually in the arena in a starting cylinder (Fig 10A) for 15 s before being released into the arena with a dead cricket (not able to flee, but able to twitch) placed in the opposite corner to the rat. The rat was allowed 10 min to explore and potentially interact with or consume the dead cricket. Day 4 and 5 was the same as day 3 with addition of placing the rat into a holding bucket for 2 min after the trial. Between all trials the arena was cleaned of all debris and wiped with water. The experimenter, not present in the same room as the rat during any of the trials, watched the trials on a screen from an anti-room. Experimenters were blind to genotype during all experiments and scoring of video trials. 
Testing sessions took place in the second week. Rats were given live-cricket-hunting trials for 5 days. Each day consisted of 4 trials, each of 2 min max duration. For each trial, the rat was first placed in the starting cylinder with the lid on in one of the four corners of the area (starting position is in a sequential order kept the same each day) for 15 s, during which a live cricket was released in the arena in the opposite corner to the rat. The starting cylinder was then removed, and the trial began. The rat was given 2 min to catch the cricket (Fig 10.B/C). The rat was removed from the arena when the cricket was eaten or if the 2 min trial duration elapsed (whichever happens first). Crickets were not reused. The arena was cleared of all debris and wiped with water between trials. Rats were held in the holding bucket between trials, the intertrial interval was approx. 1-2 min.  Ultrasonic vocalisations were recorded on day 4 or 5. On day 5 of testing, pseudorandom locations were used for the positioning of the cricket at the start of the trial, i.e. not always opposite to the rat. 
### Analysis: 
All trials were recorded. Latency to first intercept (nose within whisking distance), catch (cricket in mouth or paws) and to start to eat the cricket were scored manually either at the time of the experiment or watching back the videos (if trials were too quick to capture manually). 
Data plotted includes latency to catch the cricket from the start of the trial; rats that do not catch are assigned 120 s latency. Additional data include latency to first intercept the cricket and latency to start to eat the cricket.
Activity (e.g., distance moved and time in arena zones) was tracked using ANYmaze software to generate distance moved and % time in different zones of the arena (e.g. center and outer periphery during 10 min habituation trials when cricket was not present). 
Prey Capture Schematics A) Image of a starting cylinder in the arena. From day 3 onwards, before each trial, the rat was kept in a starting cylinder for 15 seconds as the dead/live cricket was placed in the arena; B) Image of a rat just released from the start cylinder. The rat was then given 2 min to hunt for the cricket; C) Example picture showing a rat in pursuit of the cricket. Time to intercept and eat the cricket was recorded. If the rat caught the cricket, it was given sufficient time to finish eating the cricket before being removed from the arena. Rats that did not catch the cricket were given a max latency of 120 s.

## 6. ONE TRIAL ADULT SOCIAL INTERACTION
### Apparatus: 
for this test a custom-built arena (60x60 cm, Kanya UK) with white laminated wood walls (60 cm) and a white laminated wood floor was used. The light intensity was uniformly maintained at ~20 lx. An overhead camera recorded all trials, and ultrasonic vocalisations were recorded in the test trial using a fixed microphone (Petterson 500) suspended approx. 1.5 m above the arena. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials. The experimenter was, blind to genotype throughout, watched the trials on a screen from a separate room, and was ready to intervene if any aggressive behaviour was seen (wrestling and audible vocalisations, very rare). 
### Procedure:
rats were first placed in the arena in cage groups for 10 min twice on Day 1. Test rats and the rats they were to be paired with (stimulus rats, which were unfamiliar same sex and strain and within 1-3 wks of age of the test rats) were also placed in cage groups into the arena twice for 10 min, with approximately 1-2 hr between sessions.  On Day 2, all rats were placed individually into the arena for 10 min. 
On Day 3 all rats received a test trial of 15 min duration in which the rat was placed into the arena for 5 min, and then an unfamiliar same-sex rat was introduced to the arena into the opposite corner to which the test rat was. After 10 min together, the test rat was removed from arena first and placed into a clean holding cage to avoid transferring any odours to his cage mates. Then the stimulus rat was then removed and placed back into its home cage. Stimulus rats could be used up to two times with different test rats within a day, with at least 1 hr between trials. Stimulus rats were not used in more than 3 experiments. 
### Analysis: 
Videos were scored using BORIS software to manually quantify the time that the test rat spent engaged in social exploration of the stimulus rat (nose within whisking distance, grooming, climbing on, placing paws on, boxing with, following closely or pinning the stimulus rat). Activity was tracked using ANYmaze to generate distance moved and % time in different zones of the arena (e.g. center and outer periphery during the habituation trials when the other rat was not present).
One trial social interaction task schematic during test trial. A) Test rat was put in the arena alone for 5 min; B) An unfamiliar rat was then added to the arena for a further 10 min. All social exploration was manually scored (including licking, pinning, sniffing/nose within whisking distance, close following/contact with body).

## 7. MARBLE INTERACTION (MI)
### Apparatus: 
The arena consisted of a plastic box identical to the rats’ home cage base (63 x 50 x 30 cm) with 5 cm of wood chip bedding on the floor. Two arenas were placed side by side with a wooden panel between the two arenas to prevent visual contact between rats, so that two animals could be tested simultaneously. The cage bases had white plastic panels slotted into a frame around the bases on each side to a total height of 90 cm (Fig. 6A). A CCTV camera mounted on the ceiling above the arenas recorded all trials. The light intensity was ~20 lx in the arenas. Twenty black shiny glass marbles (25 mm, Opal marble, House of Marbles, UK) were used.
### Procedure:
On day 1 and 2 rats were placed individually in the arena for 20 min with wood chip bedding and no marbles. Between rats the arena was cleared of debris and the wood chip bedding mixed and flattened out. On day 3, the rat was placed in the arena with 20 marbles positioned in a 4x5 grid on top of the wood chip bedding for 20 min (Fig. 6B). Between rats the marbles were washed with dish soap and water and dried. The experimenter was blind to genotype throughout the experiment and watched the trials on a screen from outside the testing room.
### Analysis: 
Parameters analyzed included the time spent manipulating marbles using front paws, manually scored from the videos using BORIS software (Friard, University of Torino). Distance moved was tracked using ANY-Maze (Stoelting Europe, Dublin).
